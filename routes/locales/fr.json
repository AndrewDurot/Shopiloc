				"question1" : "Why should't I shop on Amazon",
				"answer1" : "Amazon is great, but small independent shops in your area suddenly stopped getting traffic. This means unless we do an extra effort they will shut down.Your 'main' street will be filled with bankrupt shops.",
				"question2" : "What's the difference between this and Google?",
				"answer2" : "The shops you see are limited to the ones that can actually deliver personally in your area. Each shop on the list can only add a limited amount of postal codes as their delivery zone - this means you are really getting your local shops instead of the big e-com players that dominate Google",
				"question3" : "I own a shop - but don't have a site, HELP!",
				"answer3" : "We got you - click here - to have a step by step video tutorial on how to set up a Shopify store at the lowest price possible.",
				"question4" : "Why is your 'set up a store' tutorial just for Shopify?",
				"answer4" : "We don't think this is the time to debate which platform is better. We made the videos for Shopify because that's what we are fluent in - we are more then open to add tutorials on other platforms as well! The goal is to get as many independent shop owners online asap",
				"question5" : "I added my store but I don't see it!",
				"answer5" : "We manually accept new store entries - this might take a moment - we do this to limit the amount of span and because we kept the product basic",
				"question6" : "Why isn't my country featured in the search list?",
				"answer6" : "This means we don't have any stores in your country yet - and that's sad news :( - You need to help us get the word out!",
				"question7" : "When I add my store - I can't add more then 6 postal codes as delivery zones",
				"answer7" : "Yes we know - reason is that we want to keep it local. Amazon delivers everywhere, so does zara.com. This site is to give a lifeline to your local corner-store that never did any web marketing before and that stands no chance in ranking on google. That's why delivery-zones are limited.",
				"question8" : "I made a mistake in my store listing - how do I change it?",
				"answer8" : "Ow lord - we're not fancy enough yet! You need to send us an email andrew@ecomexperts.io",
				"question9" : "Are you affiliated with someone?",
				"answer9" : "We are in talks with multiple government organizations of different countries (3) and e-commerce platforms(2) but govs & multinationals take time so no official affiliation yet! :(",
				"question10" : "Is this the latest version of an item",
				"answer10" : "Each item in PrepBootstrap is maintained to its latest version. This ensures its smooth operation."
